Gigs2Go
=======

Example project for various Spring and Web technologies.

I have tried to add in everything I find interesting - Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Spring REST, MySQL 
and CloudFoundry (with MySQL), JQuery, JQueryUI, Google Blogger API ... others will be noted as I go.

The basic premise is a Spring WebApp that models a simple repository which will allow the authorised user to maintain
Artists, Venues and Events. When a new Event is added, it will be sent to a Blog as a Post.

The Blog is hosted at http://gigs2go.blogspot.co.uk.
The Application is hosted at http://gigs2go.cloudfoundry.com

This is a personal development project which I felt could be useful to share - even with the excellent 'others' out 
there, I have had to dig deep to get it all cofigured and integrated.

It is currently very simple (I haven't added the sources yet!) and is not to be taken as a model - just an example of 
how these things can be done.
